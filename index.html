      <h2>Why She is Inspiring</h2>
      <p>
        All praise be to Allah, the lord of all that exist, for he has blessed me with an amazing wife. Fatima Ezzahra Daouli, what a woman to be. I ask Allah to bless her and to make her among the pious righteous beautiful women in which he too, the exalted, has created.  My wife is inspiring. She motivates me every day to be a better husband, because every day I see her becoming a better wife. We have stories for days, and without doubt, those stories will always hold a special place in my heart. I would like to share one with you on this page to emphasize why my bubu is my inspiration.

        The first time I met Fatima, I travelled half-way across the world all because her beauty captivated my heart. I will never forget the moment I got off the airplane in Madrid, my heart was pounding and I was exceptionally nervous. Then the moment came where our eyes made contact for the first time.  She was so shy! We had an hour car ride back to Talavera De La Reina, the city she lived in and I think she only said three words to me the whole car ride. Not to mention she was staring out of the backseat window the whole time.  I am a very outgoing person, so imagining myself being married to a very shy girl really made me question whether this was the woman I wanted to marry, but I sure am glad I did. I contemplated much when I sat in her house in Spain. I prayed. I asked Allah for help and signs. Sure enough, Allah provided answers. We had a blast in Spain, walking the streets supervised by our parents, playing card games as a family, and staying up late talking to each other. It was a beautiful time. After we got engaged three days later (CRAZY RIGHT), I told her, “Fatima, do you know how beautiful you are?” Because to me she didn’t have the personality or the character that beautiful girls in America had, she wasn’t arrogant. I truly wondered if she even knew. She was absolutely breathe-taking to look at, and she still is. Anyway, she started to blush so bad, she looked like a red tomato. How innocent, Ma’Shaa’Allah. Her innocence was so beautiful. It was that moment that I became filled with inspiration. I had a mission, and she was the flame beneath it. My mission was to make her happy! She inspires me every day to make her happy, and every day I will try! To me she is my inspiration!
